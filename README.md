This is a fork of [ToggleNERDTreeAndTagbar](https://github.com/wlemuel/ToggleNERDTreeAndTagbar) with my preferred defaults:
* layout is | NERDTree | Tagbar | Buffer |
* Cursor in NERDTree after toggle

Dependencies:
* [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar)

Usage:
put something like
```vim
nmap <F7> :ToggleNERDTreeAndTagbar<CR>
```
in your vimrc, use `<F7>` to toggle NERDTree and Tagbar.
